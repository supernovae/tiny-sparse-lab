# Runtime and precision

A run records its execution engine, backend, device identity, framework versions, and declared versus tested precision capabilities. `auto` precision remains a configuration request; only a recorded probe makes a backend/precision combination tested.

CPU, CUDA/ROCm, XPU, and MPS/Metal do not have interchangeable allocator measurements. A missing device measurement is **unavailable**, not zero. MPS and MLX use unified memory, so device capacity and host RAM must never be added as two independent pools.

The dashboard shows requested precision from the resolved configuration separately from the effective precision recorded by the runtime. An unavailable probe result is not evidence that the request executed.
