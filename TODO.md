# Implementation backlog

This file tracks only repository changes that require code. Scientific questions,
campaign status, and proposed experiments belong in
[`docs/research/roadmap.md`](docs/research/roadmap.md), the versioned research
lifecycle, or a checked-in [`experiments/research/`](experiments/research/)
record. Completed work remains discoverable in Git history and evidence records;
it is not retained here as a second changelog.

When a task moves to GitHub, use the **Code task** issue template and replace the
item below with its issue link. A code item is complete only when its tests and
documentation land. An experiment result, including a negative result, does not
close a code item unless the named software acceptance criteria also pass.

Work from top to bottom within the active priorities. Favor reusable support for
prepare → lock → dispatch → train/resume → evaluate → retain evidence. Campaign
names, snapshot counts, prompts, seeds, and machine-specific measurements belong
in declarations, regression fixtures, or evidence records, not special branches
in shared lab code. Operational changes must preserve scientific settings and
artifact identities.

## Experiment ergonomics

### P2 — Make evidence collection and review reusable

- [ ] **Lint checked-in research records.** Extend existing identity/schema
  checks to validate protocol/config bindings and evidence references under
  `experiments/research/`, and reject checked-in checkpoints, caches, datasets,
  logs, and mutable run output. Complete with valid, missing/mismatched-reference,
  and forbidden-output fixtures. Validate durable declarations and references
  without requiring live external datasets/checkpoints or adding a new registry.
- [ ] **Preserve a compact metadata explanation of corpus identities.** Extend
  existing archive/provenance machinery with project/declaration identity,
  source-ID→snapshot-SHA mapping, algorithm/file provenance, full build identity
  payload, and release identity. Complete when metadata round trips and survives
  relocation, declared digest payloads can be checked without source bytes, and
  tampering is rejected. Explaining an identity must not claim verification or
  reconstruction of unavailable source contents.

## P3 — Conditional work; activate for a concrete workload

These remain implementation gaps, but should not displace P1/P2 without a
documented workload need and the required acceptance environment.

- [ ] **Implement native CUDA sparse attention.** Activate when a planned CUDA
  workload needs this path and NVIDIA hardware is available. Preserve reference
  semantics and add hardware-gated correctness tests and component benchmarks.
  CPU or another accelerator cannot close this item; component speed does not
  establish end-to-end throughput or model quality.
- [ ] **Expose verified snapshot inheritance in recovery declarations.**
  Activate when recurring corpus-version workflows need declarative reuse.
  Verified ancestry/reuse already exists in Python APIs; extend the typed
  recovery schema and CLI rather than adding another replay engine. Complete
  when explicit parent evidence and selected source IDs preserve snapshot
  identities without reacquisition, and tampered parents or incompatible source
  declarations are rejected. Use generic ancestry fixtures rather than requiring
  a particular campaign's versions or snapshot counts.
- [ ] **Add an operational spot-safety policy.** Activate for a recurring spot
  executor workload. Existing checkpoint cadence, retention, verification, and
  explicit child resume are foundations, not missing features. Add a separately
  configured policy using observed checkpoint write time, interruption notice,
  workspace capacity, and measured restart cost; record its chosen cadence while
  preserving scientific settings. Cover unavailable measurements, insufficient
  capacity, and the separation of operational cadence from scientific identity.

## Boundaries and acceptance work

Distributed training is deferred under the
[single-host extension decision](docs/decisions/0015-single-host-extension-boundaries.md).
It is not an active compatibility/refactoring task. A future proposal must
define optimizer ownership, data partitioning, checkpoint identity, and MoE
expert placement before implementation.

Real spot/remote recovery validation belongs in operational acceptance records,
following the existing [worker acceptance evidence](docs/workers.md#observed-acceptance--2026-09-23).
Exercise abrupt loss, verified-generation selection, explicit child resume,
remote artifact transfer, and storage retention before claiming spot cost or
recovery benefits. Local loss/resume evidence does not close that gate; add code
tasks here only for missing or defective behavior exposed by acceptance.
