"""Every registered verifier kind must authorize on the current source tree.

Without this, an edit that drifts a pinned exclusion signature or pulls a
dynamic import into a verifier closure silently turns every signed reuse into
a full rehash (reason "unknown"), and only slow end-to-end tests notice.
When this fails, re-audit the reported edge before re-pinning it.
