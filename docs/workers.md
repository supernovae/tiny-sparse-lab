# Independent workers

One worker executes a whole experiment with its own optimizer, RNG, local database, checkpoints, and immutable inputs. The controller owns a separate local queue and read-only-result projection. Local and SSH workers use the same versioned, finite stdio endpoint; neither is a persistent GPU daemon. This is independent experiment scheduling, not distributed training.

The global `--work-dir PATH` option (before the command) selects the persistent
root ahead of `SPARSELAB_WORK_DIR`; the implicit root is
`${XDG_DATA_HOME}/sparselab` for an absolute, nonempty XDG setting, otherwise
`~/.local/share/sparselab`. For substantial work use, for example,
`export SPARSELAB_WORK_DIR=/data/sparselab` on a sufficiently sized filesystem.
Study submission and research scaffolding use that root for implicit
`<work-dir>/experiments/<study-name>` workspaces, and generic controller commands
use `<work-dir>/runs`. Local worker child processes inherit temporary-directory
settings pointing to `<work-dir>/scratch`, not the durable root; RPC fallback
scratch is disposable. SSH workers resolve their own root on the remote host,
so configure their environment separately. Explicit `--store`, `--runs-dir`,
`--output`, cache and configured logging paths keep their exact meaning; they
are not relocated by the selected root. An in-checkout persistent root or
explicit long-lived output/cache path warns `STORAGE_INSIDE_GIT_CHECKOUT` but
continues. Legacy `sparselab-work/` is selectable explicitly and never migrated
automatically; branches or worktrees do not create scientific or storage IDs.


## Local operation

Prepare the tokenizer and use a concrete configuration whose backend and precision the worker supports:

```sh
export SPARSELAB_WORK_DIR=/data/sparselab
WORK="$SPARSELAB_WORK_DIR/experiments/runtime-smoke"
mkdir -p "$WORK"
sparselab worker register cpu-one --backend cpu --store "$WORK/runs"
sparselab worker status cpu-one --json --store "$WORK/runs"
sparselab experiment submit configs/runtime_smoke_cpu.yaml --worker cpu-one --store "$WORK/runs"
sparselab controller run --store "$WORK/runs"
```

Run the controller in its own terminal. From another terminal, use the same `--store`:

```sh
sparselab experiment list --json --store "$WORK/runs"
sparselab experiment cancel RUN_ID --store "$WORK/runs"
sparselab experiment resume RUN_ID --worker cpu-one --store "$WORK/runs"
```

`--worker NAME` is a hard binding. Without one, queued submissions use eligible idle registered workers; a preferred worker is only a tie-breaker. Eligibility checks engine, backend, features, tested precision, required schema/codecs, source identity, and measured memory requirements. Unknown capacity never satisfies a numeric minimum. No eligible worker means `QUEUED` with a reason, not a silently changed configuration.

For a single composed local experiment, `sparselab run CONFIG --store ROOT` registers a controller-scoped local endpoint and drives the same queue, isolated smoke/warmup, training, and ingestion path. `run CONFIG --worker NAME` targets an existing worker. If another controller owns the store lock, `run` observes it rather than competing for assignments. `train CONFIG` remains the direct single-host entry point and does not silently run staging pilots.

`controller run` and composed `run` accept `--transfer-timeout SECONDS` (default 1800). It is a finite per-RPC deadline for bundle and artifact transfers, including hashing and transmission; increase it explicitly for a slow link or large input. Metadata requests have shorter bounded deadlines. Killing the controller never authorizes re-execution of an assigned optimizer attempt.

## Machine-local runtime selection

`sparselab runtime env` manages a host-local interpreter registry, not worker
registrations or scientific locks. Inspect hardware and installed Python environments
separately; inventory alone does not authorize a backend. A CPU checkout example:

```sh
sparselab runtime env discover --json
sparselab runtime env register cpu-py314 --python "$PWD/.venv/bin/python" --backend cpu --json
sparselab runtime env list --json
sparselab runtime env doctor cpu-py314 --json
sparselab stage configs/runtime_smoke_cpu.yaml --through inspect \
  --runtime cpu-py314 --output /absolute/disposable/stage
```

The provision-created runtime root is `SPARSELAB_RUNTIME_DIR` if explicitly
absolute, else `$XDG_DATA_HOME/sparselab/runtimes` if XDG is absolute/nonblank,
else `~/.local/share/sparselab/runtimes`. The registry uses the corresponding
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sparselab/runtimes.yaml` or
`~/.config/sparselab/runtimes.yaml`. Both are independent of
`SPARSELAB_WORK_DIR` and the scientific lock. Existing interpreters can be
registered outside the runtime root. Never copy registry entries to another
host: register and doctor the actual interpreter there; remote worker capabilities
remain authoritative on that host. `--runtime ID` resolves a local profile,
while `--worker NAME` selects a worker endpoint; they are not interchangeable.

The following **user-provisioned** registrations select the framework/device
used to execute a workload. They are setup examples, not experiment definitions.
Each interpreter
must already contain a compatible SparseLab source and actual working device;
registration runs a real optimizer doctor and refuses unavailable backends.
MLX uses `--backend metal` (its profile engine is MLX).

```sh
sparselab runtime env register cuda-local --python /absolute/cuda/bin/python --backend cuda --json
sparselab runtime env register xpu-local --python /absolute/xpu/bin/python --backend xpu --json
sparselab runtime env register mps-local --python /absolute/mps/bin/python --backend mps --json
sparselab runtime env register mlx-local --python /absolute/mlx/bin/python --backend metal --json
sparselab runtime env doctor cuda-local --json
```

The sole automatic vendor recipe is the **candidate** `rocm-gfx1100-v1`:
`sparselab runtime env provision rocm-7900xtx --recipe rocm-gfx1100-v1 --json`.
It requires verified host/driver support, Linux x86_64, an existing Python 3.14
executable, writable local runtime storage with at least 20 GiB free and 100,000
free inodes. This command installs into a new runtime-root path, not the checkout
`.venv`; failure retains the partial environment unregistered. There is no automatic
garbage collection. Do not sync a CPU extra into a vendor environment or treat
installation success as confirmation that the selected workload will run. Details:
[machine-local runtime environments](runtime.md#machine-local-runtime-environments).

## User-provisioned SSH workers

The following is an example for an already provisioned host, not evidence that such a host is available:

```sh
sparselab worker register amd --backend rocm --ssh amd-host \
  --python /opt/sparselab/bin/python --root /srv/sparselab/amd \
  --store "$WORK/runs"
```

The SSH alias must already be configured in the user's SSH environment. Transport uses strict host-key checking and `BatchMode=yes`; it does not store passwords, accept unknown host keys, install software remotely, or execute commands from experiment configurations. Interpreter and worker-root paths are absolute. The endpoint runs a fixed, shell-quoted agent command. Worker roots are private and bound to an immutable registration.

Provision each target with its vendor-compatible PyTorch/runtime and the
project wheel. Base SparseLab is Torch-free; `--extra cpu` explicitly opts into
CPU PyTorch for development and CI. The lightweight `sparselab runtime env`
entry works without Torch, but the full CLI still imports a backend framework.
Do not apply the CPU extra to accelerator workers. **Select the provisioned
interpreter directly, or set `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` to its environment prefix
and use `uv run --locked --no-sync` for every command in a provisioned accelerator
checkout.** A syncing `uv run --locked --extra cpu` can replace a vendor wheel
with CPU PyTorch. Check the installed framework API and actual device before
staging (for ROCm: `torch.version.hip`, `torch.cuda.is_available()`, and
`torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)`), and require explicit backend validation at
warmup. An unknown device or missing vendor runtime is a provisioning decision
to escalate, not a signal to select another backend from the host OS or an old
run manifest. Record actual driver/framework/runtime versions and perform the
worker's concrete validation. PyTorch MPS and optional MLX Metal are different
engines sharing the same physical Apple GPU lease.

Choose the host environment and backend independently: a WSL2 worker is a Linux
worker that can request CPU, CUDA, ROCm, or XPU when its installed stack and
hardware support that backend. Registration does not infer a GPU vendor from
WSL2 or from the worker's name. Apply the same protocol, staging, device leases,
and task-owned store conventions on native Linux and WSL2. See
[host environment and compute backend](runtime.md#host-environment-and-compute-backend)
for filesystem, driver, telemetry, and acceptance boundaries.

The optional [gfx1100 provisioning requirements](../requirements/rocm-gfx1100.txt)
retain the existing AMD worker's Python 3.14/ROCm package pins. They are an
explicit device-specific provisioning input, not a Linux or WSL2 default and
not a prescription for every AMD GPU. Other AMD devices, NVIDIA CUDA, and Intel
XPU workers use their own compatible vendor stack. The base project wheel has
no PyTorch dependency; provision the vendor framework separately and install
SparseLab without resolving or replacing that framework (for example, with
`uv pip install --python /absolute/vendor/bin/python --no-deps --editable .`
from the checkout). Keep the vendor package constraints when resolving other
dependencies. On Apple arm64, MLX remains opt-in; the full CLI currently needs
both `--extra mlx` and `--extra cpu` in a managed project environment.

## Supplied Colab workers and relay-backed recovery

Colab is a user-supplied, single foreground notebook kernel, not an SSH host,
daemon, or scheduler. Before any automatic kernel execution, generate the
fixed enrollment cell with `sparselab hosted notebook-cell --root
/content/sparselab --output ABSOLUTE_PATH --json`, then run that cell manually
in a dedicated notebook. The observer records boot, PID, and process-start
identity through the Contents API. Unknown or `BUSY` occupancy refuses work; it
is never queued behind another cell.

Register only the setup-returned absolute interpreter and worker root with
`worker register NAME --colab-session SESSION --backend cuda --python PYTHON
--root ROOT --relay-profile PROFILE --store STORE`. Colab requires the relay.
The local controller starts one official foreground execution only after a
native prepared receipt; while it is occupied, passive status and relay
collection make no kernel `exec` call. See the
[hosted guide](hosted-environments.md) for enrollment, setup, and exact
provider boundaries.

Relay checkpoint publication is synchronous: the optimizer cannot advance past
a finalized checkpoint boundary until its immutable, authenticated recovery
closure has been uploaded and read back. Transfer time is recorded separately.
Each attempt has a private 32-byte HMAC key outside the relay and scientific
artifacts; credentials and keys never enter a profile, declaration, manifest,
or log. Relay is a verified object copy, never a live SQLite/WAL or training
filesystem.


## Preparation and durable identity

Submission verifies and seals an engine-neutral dispatch bundle before atomically reserving experiment, attempt, and run IDs. It contains exact tokenizer/data/package bytes, configuration and source identities, supported version requirements, and selected continuation artifacts. Original input paths are not needed after successful preparation. Promotion must match the requested tokenizer/package identity before any path is rebased; full resume can prepare from verified parent-owned inputs after the originals are gone.

The worker checks its content-addressed cache, installs only missing verified assets, revalidates its actual runtime, and runs disposable smoke/warmup pilots. Pilots are separate runs and never advance the experiment's optimizer, schedule, cursor, RNG, or target budget. Memory failure produces a proposal rather than silently reducing scientific settings.

A durable `PREPARED` receipt precedes spawning. A nonblocking attempt claim prevents duplicate wrappers from training. A claimed execution records PID, process-start identity, boot identity, start token, and phase before training. Replaying the same launch returns the same receipt; conflicting identities fail. `RUNNING` and terminal attempts are never restarted under their old IDs.

Each configured worker has one logical slot. Host-wide OS leases additionally serialize aliases of the same accelerator across scratch roots; an unknown accelerator identity conservatively excludes other accelerator work. Isolated pilots inherit the lease, so killing their wrapper cannot release hardware while a child still owns it. This namespace assumes one service account per host, not coordination across unrelated user accounts.

## Cancellation, disconnects, and explicit recovery

- Cancelling a queued experiment creates no executor. An assigned cancellation remains durable through a lost RPC and is redelivered until evidence arrives.
- A marker arriving before preparation is retained without inventing a receipt or acknowledgement. Once preparation is known and unclaimed, cancellation can acknowledge without initializing a model.
- Staging checks cancellation at pilot boundaries; an executing pilot and the trainer stop at committed update boundaries. After model initialization, even a step-zero interruption has a real full checkpoint. There is no fabricated pre-initialization checkpoint.
- `CANCEL_REQUESTED` is intent. Acknowledged interruption becomes `CANCELLED`; natural completion already committed at the budget wins a late request.
- A controller disconnect does not stop worker updates. Reconnection resumes record/artifact ingestion, not optimizer execution.
- A lost executor is finalized only after its attempt claim and inherited resource holders are gone. It remains `UNKNOWN`; verified finalized generations are available for an explicit child resume. Missing crash-window manifest/checkpoint projections can be reconstructed from those verified files without creating an echo outbox. Conflicting metadata is rejected, never overwritten.
- Resume creates a new visible child with the selected full-state digest. It requires compatible same-engine/backend training state and a remaining scientific budget. Complete budgets cannot resume. Source/runtime drift requires explicit `--allow-runtime-drift` and remains best-effort, not an architecture/data compatibility bypass.

Execution state and `ingestion_status` are separate durable facts. A remotely complete receipt does not mean its checkpoints are already locally available. Composed `run` waits for `COMPLETE` or `NOT_REQUIRED` ingestion for every terminal outcome, including cancellation and failure. Queued cancellation and failures with no run artifacts require no transfer; they do not fabricate a checkpoint. Full resume is admitted only after verified local ingestion. Artifact-transfer errors remain visible and can be retried without rerunning the optimizer.

## Local aggregation and integrity

Every worker's database/WAL stays local. The controller imports contiguous `(origin_id, sequence)` envelopes, rejects conflicting duplicates or gaps, and never re-emits imported records into its own outbox. Live runs therefore have real local metric series before completion.

Terminal artifacts are downloaded into a private temporary directory, checked against the receipt and sealed dispatch, then atomically published. Checks bind attempt/run/experiment/worker IDs, requested and effective configurations, source policy, continuation lineage, matrix coordinate, exact input identities, full-native checkpoint state, terminal counters, and replicated manifest/checkpoint metadata. Checkpoint generations use their embedded canonical digest; a file's transport hash is not that identity. Logs are sealed snapshots rather than mutable live files. Failed pre-training attempts with only diagnostic logs do not claim a resumable run.

Protocol v1 uses a bounded canonical JSON header and length/hash-framed attachments. Unknown versions/operations, duplicate JSON keys, nonfinite/coerced scalar values, unsafe names, symlink destinations, excess sizes, truncated bodies, and conflicting hashes fail closed. Error responses cannot carry attachments. A `cancel` response may contain no receipt only while its marker precedes preparation; acknowledgement is then false.

Native state codecs are engine-specific: PyTorch uses `pytorch_native/v2`; MLX uses `mlx_native/v1`. Capability advertisement and dispatch requirements derive these versions from their implemented codecs rather than treating a generic checkpoint schema version as every engine's native-state version.

## Explicit matrices

A version-1 matrix names a base configuration and insertion-ordered axes. Each option has a label and explicit dotted-path `set` patch. Expansion rejects duplicate labels, overlapping paths, unknown keys, invalid resulting configurations, and more than 1000 coordinates unless `--max-runs` is explicitly increased.

```sh
sparselab experiment submit --matrix MATRIX.yaml --dry-run --store "$WORK/runs"
sparselab experiment submit --matrix MATRIX.yaml --store "$WORK/runs"
```

Dry-run resolves the complete coordinates, configuration hashes, and scheduling constraints without creating the controller store, preparing data, probing devices, or enqueueing. Non-dry-run preparation must succeed for every coordinate before the queue transaction. Each coordinate receives independent IDs and retains the matrix digest and labels in its spec and resulting manifest.

## Comparison and hardware limits

The read-only dashboard can use the controller root as `--runs-dir`. Compare actual observed losses/counters and keep differences in optimizer, precision, architecture, data/tokenizer, effective batch, backend, and budget visible. Equal worker names or similar parameter counts do not make a controlled scientific comparison.

Worker names are labels; their reported backend describes the actual execution
device. A worker running on CPU reports CPU regardless of its name. Checking
GPU dispatch or simultaneous work across hosts requires those provisioned
environments. SSH framing and quoting tests check transport behavior; they do
not measure remote driver or kernel performance.

No worker shares optimizer state or exchanges gradients/expert tokens with another. There is no process group, all-reduce, expert all-to-all, tensor/model sharding, or heterogeneous distributed backward. Pending implementation and hardware-validation directions are summarized in [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md); proposed code work belongs in GitHub issues, with implementation, review and CI tracked in pull requests and their checks. Scientific questions stay in the research roadmap/lifecycle.

## Observed acceptance — 2026-09-23

[Worker gate record](../artifacts/acceptance/independent_workers_2026_09_23.json) binds the execution wheel, source identity, commands, native checkpoints, counters, independent checks and retained evidence hashes. The acceptance-time suite passed 335 tests and Ruff lint/format checks; later regression results remain with their evidence records and commits.

- Three genuine CPU workers overlapped with FP32 AdamW, FP32 Adafactor and BF16 AdamW. Their updates continued while the controller was stopped; reconnect imported contiguous, deduplicated records with no echo outbox.
- Replaying launch retained the original process identity. Cancellation stopped at update 26,943; an explicit child reached 32,768 updates / 2,097,152 targets. Its model, optimizer, RNG, cursor, scaler, schedule and counters matched an uninterrupted baseline bitwise. Wall-clock checkpoint cadence was not compared bitwise.
- A separate identity-checked executor SIGKILL left an immutable UNKNOWN attempt. Its verified step-256 checkpoint resumed only through a new child, reaching exactly 32,768 updates / 1,048,576 targets without changing parent files.
- Installed CLI matrix submission executed all three coordinates at exactly 2 updates / 64 targets. Actual incompatible engine/capacity and a worker with genuinely different installed source remained queued without an executor.
- Core-only installed execution after removing owned original inputs proved offline promotion, fresh optimizer/RNG/counters, evaluation, generation, unchanged parent files, and composed local `run` without prior registration. An actual MLX/Metal worker completed 4 updates / 128 targets; its full native checkpoint also verified from the core-only installation without MLX.
- [Captured dashboard curves](../artifacts/acceptance/workers_training_2026_09_23.svg) contain actual browser WebGL pixels and SVG overlays, not regenerated series. Standard screenshot capture and runtime-table rasterization stalled, including independent browser attempts. The real Runtime view was additionally exercised through Streamlit's app harness: all three CPU/worker/precision/optimizer rows were correct and the database data version was unchanged.

These synthetic workloads establish orchestration and state-transition behavior, not model quality. Worker labels do not establish AMD/Intel hardware execution. No actual SSH target, CUDA/HIP kernel, ROCm/XPU acceptance, or overlapping real three-host result is claimed.
