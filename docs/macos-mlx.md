# Native MLX on Apple Silicon

Commands below use the [activated, provisioned environment](../README.md#first-run).

Run Lab directly on an Apple Silicon Mac with macOS 14 or newer, an installed
stable CPython 3.14 interpreter, and uv. Use an arm64 terminal and interpreter,
not an x86_64 Rosetta environment. Linux containers on a Mac do not expose Metal;
there is no MLX/Metal container image in this delivery path.

The lock selects **MLX 0.32.4**, **mlx-metal 0.32.4**, and **PyTorch 2.14.1**.
Published stable wheels cover CPython 3.14 on macOS arm64; mlx-metal supplies the
Metal runtime. PyTorch is installed because the full Lab CLI currently imports
it even when a declaration selects MLX. Installing the `cpu` extra on macOS
selects the native PyPI Torch wheel, not the Linux CPU wheel index. It does not
change a declaration's engine or select a CPU fallback.

## Install once and reuse

These commands install locked dependencies into this checkout's persistent
`.venv`. They require network access for the first installation, but do not
fetch models or datasets. Keep each active experiment's checkout pinned until
its run finishes; use a separate checkout when trying a new Lab revision.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/supernovae/tiny-sparse-lab.git
cd tiny-sparse-lab
export UV_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS=never
uv sync --locked --python python3.14 --no-dev --extra cpu --extra mlx \
  --no-build-package mlx --no-build-package mlx-metal --no-build-package torch
. .venv/bin/activate
export SPARSELAB_WORK_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/sparselab"
sparselab --help
sparselab runtime env discover --json
```

The wheel-only restrictions on the three framework packages fail if a compatible
published wheel is unavailable. No nightly index, Python downgrade, source build
of a framework, or automatic interpreter download is used. Discovery inventories
availability; it is not a successful GPU workload test. The command above does
not validate or launch an experiment.

Lab is installed editable by `uv sync`. For a later reviewed source revision,
update an idle checkout with Git and repeat the same locked sync command. uv
keeps already satisfied dependency versions; application-only changes do not
rebuild or redownload MLX, Metal, or Torch. Keep `.venv` and uv's download cache
on the Mac. If `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, Python, architecture, or macOS changes,
sync again and inspect the resulting runtime before executing work. Do not copy
a virtual environment between Macs or publish it as an OS-independent image.
Direct commands use the activated environment without checking or repairing
dependency drift; synchronize the selected revision explicitly first.

## Use the existing Lab commands

Choose `engine: mlx` and `backend: metal` in the native RunConfig's `runtime`
section. See [runtime capabilities](runtime.md) for the supported operations and
restrictions; MLX is separate from PyTorch MPS. Existing [lab mode](lab-mode.md)
commands consume those declarations. The current MLX path supports FP32 dense
and native block-sparse models. Unsupported model features and mixed precision
remain errors; packaging does not add capabilities.

Open the native viewer in a separate terminal using the same work root:

```sh
. .venv/bin/activate
export SPARSELAB_WORK_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/sparselab"
sparselab dashboard
```

The viewer binds to localhost and reads the local work store. Each Mac keeps its
own persistent results; this guide does not create shared storage or remote
workers. Dataset preparation and experiments remain separate deliberate actions.

## Verification boundary

This delivery path updates locked wheel metadata and documents existing native
commands. It has not been installed or exercised on macOS with these new pins.
Linux CI checks are not Metal validation. Before relying on results from the new
runtime, perform the separately authorized native validation and small MLX test
selection described in [testing](test-speed.md) on the actual Mac. Existing
historical MLX results in the runtime guide do not validate these new wheels.
There is no automatic macOS or accelerator build matrix for application updates.
