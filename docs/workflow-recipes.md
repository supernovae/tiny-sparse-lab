# External prepared-input workflow locks

This profile connects an inventoried external recipe to
native artifact verification and lock publication. It starts **after native
preparation has produced a tokenizer and prepared-data artifact**. The metadata
operations do not run a preparation graph or submit training; explicit CPU
execution is described below. `portable_workflow_version: 1` is a separate profile from the unchanged `portable_recipe_version: 1` matrix preview.

The execution and CLI sections below describe the supported contract.

Use three explicit operations:

```sh
sparselab experiment recipe workflow inspect recipe/workflow.yaml --bindings local.yaml --json
sparselab experiment recipe workflow resolve recipe/workflow.yaml --bindings local.yaml --json
sparselab experiment recipe workflow publish recipe/workflow.yaml --bindings local.yaml --workspace /absolute/work/experiment --json
```

`inspect` reads bounded metadata only, validates native config expansion and
reports artifacts as unverified and runtime capability as unknown. It does not
open payloads, load optional computation, probe a runtime, create a work root or
launch a process. `resolve` cold-verifies the already available artifacts and
calls native `resolve_plan`; it does not publish. `publish` resolves and uses
native `publish_lock`, including no-clobber availability sidecars and artifact
reverification. All three report `executable: false`. Global work/token-file
options are ignored by this recipe route; publication requires its own explicit
`--workspace`.

## Portable descriptor and local bindings

The descriptor directory is the explicit recipe root, regardless of an enclosing
Git checkout or current directory. Example (replace every digest and identifier
with the real native identity):

```yaml
portable_workflow_version: 1
id: prepared-width-study
entrypoint: plans/plan.yaml
contracts: {experiment_plan: 1, run_config: 2}
files:
  - {path: plans/plan.yaml, role: experiment_plan, sha256: <exact file SHA-256>}
  - {path: configs/run.json, role: run_config, sha256: <exact file SHA-256>}
artifacts:
  token:
    kind: tokenizer
    version: 1
    producer: sparselab tokenizer train
    identifier: tokenizer
    sha256: <native tokenizer SHA-256>
  packed:
    kind: prepared_data
    version: 1
    producer: sparselab data prepare
    identifier: <native settings SHA-256>
    sha256: <native manifest SHA-256>
```

`plans/plan.yaml` is an ordinary `plan_version: 1` declaration with
`base_run: configs/run.json` and
`inputs: {tokenizer: token, prepared_data: packed}`. References are recipe-root
relative and must be inventoried. The profile supplies native Artifact values
in memory from the identity and binding documents; it writes no intermediate
plan YAML and duplicates no preparation or verifier logic.

The separate local document can live outside the recipe:

```yaml
workflow_bindings_version: 1
artifacts:
  token: /data/tokenizer/tokenizer.json
  packed: /data/cache/native-prepared-id
logging_root: /work/runs
config_paths: {}
```

Local relative paths anchor to the **bindings document's directory**; absolute
paths are permitted. Traversal, ambiguous spellings and symlinks are refused.
The inventory retains the shared limits of 64 members, 1 MiB per document and
8 MiB total recipe metadata; the separate bindings document is limited to 1 MiB.
Locations need not exist for inspection. Native verification requires them at
resolution. Tokenizer path comes from its artifact binding, cache directory from
the prepared artifact's parent, and logging root from its explicit binding.
`config_paths` must supply exactly any other present native typed input paths,
such as snapshot train/validation/manifest locations. Unknown fields and
capability assertions are rejected. Native verifiers still decide whether these
locations and artifacts agree with the scientific config; bindings cannot
substitute for verification.

Config documents retain canonical relative path spellings. Only supported
model-owned Path fields are bound; arbitrary metadata/plugin `path` keys remain
opaque. Path-changing axes (including whole-section patches) and mixture paths
are unavailable. The first profile requires exactly one tokenizer and one
prepared-data identity. Additional artifact kinds, corpus variants, authored
phases, inline evaluations, attempt contracts and worker/workspace declarations
are explicitly refused. An inventoried diagnostic suite is supported only with
the explicit Campaign contract below. Native APIs retain their existing capabilities.

## Identity, context and admission

The new recipe fingerprint is SHA-256 of `sparselab-portable-workflow-v1\0` plus
canonical validated descriptor JSON, with inventory sorted by path. It includes
member byte hashes and typed artifact identities. Descriptor formatting has a
separate byte digest. Bindings have their own byte digest and are excluded from
the recipe fingerprint. This does not define new scientific equivalence: native
scientific/config/lock hashes and backend/precision distinctions remain intact.
Legacy seed coercion (`true`, `"7"`, `7.0`) is preserved. Version fields in the new
contracts reject booleans. No historical hashes or records are rewritten.

An immutable RecipeContext carries inventoried bytes and explicit local config
bindings into the native planner through `recipe_run_config` and `resolve_plan`. The
pinned legacy `base_run_config` function stays byte-for-byte unchanged; calls
without a context retain historical declaration lookup and serialization. Contextual
resolution records recipe-root inventory digests in availability, without Git or
CWD fallback. The workflow annotation records descriptor/binding identity and
locations in the native availability sidecar. Adding that annotation forfeits
the resolver's object-local proof reuse: publication deliberately reverifies.
No verifier exclusions change.

**A published workflow lock is not an execution grant.** Both the experiment run
route and the shared CLI/Campaign worker-request constructor refuse this profile
with `WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_UNAVAILABLE` unless the shared request constructor receives
the authenticated CPU execution context described below, before selecting/submitting work. Unknown
or stale capability information cannot make it ready; there is no capability
input or override. Existing legacy admission and recovery paths are unchanged.

## Change-impact map and remaining work

| Boundary | Tests |
| --- | --- |
| Descriptor/inventory/local bindings | Exact digests, inventory order, strict versions, changed content, traversal/symlinks, opaque metadata, unknown binding/capability fields |
| Explicit context → native planner | Snapshot versus changed disk, decoy source directory/CWD, native identity parity, legacy recipe/native-plan regressions |
| Metadata versus artifact operations | Fresh-process CLI/help import/write/network/process/payload fences; unsupported features refused before optional imports |
| Native verification → publication | Tiny synthetic tokenizer/packing fixtures, changed-artifact refusal before publication, native reopen, immutable availability collision |
| Lock → execution boundary | CLI selection spy and shared Campaign/CLI request refusal; no worker submission or runtime probe |
| Compatibility | Legacy seeds, native science under changed logging binding, verifier authority, declaration preflight, normal safe/fast/tiny CPU lab-loop CI |

Remaining work includes broader artifact/operation contracts, independent
Workshop authoring and measured portability at its final pins. The preparation
and authenticated synthetic CPU contracts below connect to the existing
CampaignEngine/Controller and their gates. Actual TinyStories CPU/GPU portability,
scientific comparison qualification and any release remain separately admitted.

## Refusal and guidance follow-up

The focused guards also cover binding documents overlapping the descriptor or
inventory, artifact kinds at input ports, execution workspace/worker fields,
base-config inventory role, undeclared native path bindings, context bindings for
uninventoried configs, and direct native contextual resolution of unsupported
variants/suites/attempt contracts. Exact errors and read/verifier spies distinguish
these guards from incidental failures. Overlap is rejected before interpreting a
file as local bindings. Member-role lookup has an explicit `None` default;
uninventoried references still fail earlier in `RecipeContext.reference`.

The nested `workflow_profile.execution: unavailable` value is explanatory. The
existing execution authority tests the **presence of `workflow_profile`** in the
authenticated availability sidecar. Removing the explanatory value does not grant
execution; no test treats that informational mutation as a security failure.

A published-profile iteration check reconstructs descriptor-supplied declarations
from the authenticated sidecar, verifies descriptor/binding/inventory identities,
and returns the explicit `WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_UNAVAILABLE` gate. The former
`DECLARATION_OR_LOCK_INVALID` regression was replaced with this stronger boundary;
malformed or changed declarations still retain their own errors. Inventory
integrity does not establish committed provenance. CLI/shared Campaign execution
refusal remains unchanged. See [preparation planning](preparation-recipes.md) for
the new separate inspect-only contract and remaining admission/context work.


## Prepared-input CPU execution

The narrow execution contract adds optional `campaign: campaign.json` to the
workflow descriptor. Inventory that native Campaign and its evaluation suite as
`metadata` members. The Campaign owns the connections: two artifact references,
one experiment-plan lock, runtime acceptance, explicit approval, one
`main:single` run, checkpoint collection, evaluation and terminal evidence collection. Stage IDs are authored, not fixed.
Artifact-reference IDs name the descriptor artifacts; their `artifact` objects
contain exactly the descriptor identity fields, with no path. Locations come
only from local bindings. The experiment-plan stage references the inventoried
entrypoint; its suite references one inventoried diagnostic `heldout_lm` suite.
The existing typed Campaign validator checks dependencies and producer kinds.

`WorkflowExecution` accepts the descriptor, bindings, absolute work root outside
Git and one current `WorkflowAdmission` containing the reviewed recipe commit,
recipe and binding digests, current CPU Python and explicit `limits`. These are explicit caller
assertions, not remote author attestation. Alternatively select exact descriptor
bytes with `reviewed_descriptor_sha256` instead of `reviewed_commit`, as described in
[content admission](portable-recipes.md#explicit-content-admission-outside-git).
It requires unchanged authenticated inventory, one unexpanded synthetic CPU PyTorch cell, and local native runtime
acceptance. Profile/worker selection, accelerator evaluation, continuations, acquisition and
alternate evaluation kinds remain unavailable. The controlled snapshot pair below
uses the same admission contract and graph validator.

```python
from sparselab.experiments.workflow_execution import (
    WorkflowAdmission,
    WorkflowExecution,
)

context = WorkflowExecution(descriptor, bindings, work_root, admission)
engine = context.engine()
planned = engine.apply()  # verifies inputs, publishes native lock, awaits approval
engine.approve(gate_id, "approve", "explicitly authorized bounded CPU experiment")
completed = engine.apply(execute_runs=True, max_wait_seconds=540)
replayed = engine.apply(resume=True, execute_runs=False)
```

Use native operational monitoring around the complete process tree. A one-update
main config does not bound pilots or runtime probes. The measured fixture uses
600-second, 4-GiB RSS and 1-GiB workspace-growth stop ceilings; sampled monitoring
is not an instantaneous kernel quota. The CLI below exposes the native executor
and report APIs without adding a scheduler.
The existing collection and publication-report APIs read the resulting native
lock, Controller evidence and checkpoint-bound evaluation. Rendering conveys
integrity and coverage, not scientific effectiveness or automatic promotion.

Context is refreshed at admission, approval, every dispatch and receipt boundary,
and the shared locked-cell request. The native availability sidecar authenticates
recipe, inventory and binding identity; Campaign receipts and submitted request
provenance retain the explicit admission. A changed committed recipe or local
binding cannot be admitted by replaying old approval receipts. Ordinary
`experiment run` and iteration remain unable to grant this execution context.
Existing workflow descriptors without `campaign` retain their original recipe
fingerprint; historical config, scientific, lock and receipt hash algorithms and
legacy seed coercion are unchanged.

| Change / boundary | Regression evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Changed descriptor, inventory, binding, suite or reviewed commit | Refusal before dispatch and work-store creation |
| Authored Campaign connections | Native typed edges plus required explicit approval |
| Native lock/request authority | Real plan-to-approval path; lock without context refuses; stale binding refuses shared request |
| Metadata inspection | Fresh-process import, filesystem, subprocess and payload fence |
| Evaluation declaration separation | Existing schema/runtime readers share the unchanged data-only models |

The bounded actual CPU proof is additional wiring evidence. TinyStories,
accelerator portability, broader contracts and scientific comparison qualification
remain separately scoped work.



## Snapshot-backed paired execution

The same workflow descriptor and public CLI support one native snapshot-backed
pair. Both single and paired workflows require `limits` as a
caller-selected preflight launch allowance for this advanced portable workflow:
"do not launch a recipe declaring more work than I approved." For example, it
can refuse an accidental million-step arm when the operator approved a smaller
pair, without rewriting either configuration. Ordinary `try`/`report` is
unaffected. There are no fixed small defaults or built-in upper ceilings; users
choose allowances appropriate to their full experiments. The values below are
an illustration, not a lab-wide experiment budget.

The allowance aggregates declared main + smoke + warmup updates/target positions
and bounds evaluation batches **per call**. It does not bound total compute,
runtime memory/time/storage, optimizer probes, all scoring or retry charges.
Native run horizons still govern training, `ResourceEnvelope` governs its
supported operational controls, and native attempt contracts provide separate
durable accounting where supported. WorkflowLimits does not replace those contracts
or grant runtime allocation. Portable attempt-contract support remains deferred.

```yaml
limits:
  max_training_updates: 18
  max_target_positions: 576
  max_eval_batches: 1
```

These are explicit declaration ceilings, not a compute allocation or an operating
system quota. Training updates sum `training.max_steps + staging.smoke_steps +
staging.warmup_steps` across both cells. Target positions multiply each cell's
update ceiling by sequence length, micro-batch size and gradient accumulation;
this conservatively counts the full step horizon even if `max_tokens` stops main
training earlier. The evaluation ceiling applies to each scoring call, including
pilot and main-run validation and the diagnostic suite. Runtime optimizer probes,
pilot reload forwards, scoring-call count, wall time, memory and storage must be
budgeted separately around the entire native process tree. Replay does not grant
new workload credit. Admission integers reject booleans and strings; existing
RunConfig seed coercion is unchanged.

Author exactly one native axis with two named choices and one `controlled`
comparison selecting those choices. Each choice explicitly states its setting;
the native lock contains both complete resolved configurations. Declare exactly
one intervention under `model`, `attention` or `optimizer`, plus the desired native
leaf-field invariants. Native comparison validation rejects absent, extra or
unchanged interventions and violated invariants. Data, tokenizer, seed, runtime,
training exposure and evaluation protocol cannot be changed as the intervention.
Both cells must use the base configuration's snapshot dataset and tokenizer.
Native verification binds the snapshot manifest and members, tokenizer provenance,
prepared cache, packing settings and source identity before runtime dispatch.
A packing-sensitive intervention still requires matching native inputs; admission
does not make a shared incompatible cache valid.

The authored Campaign has two artifact-reference stages, one plan lock, one local
CPU runtime acceptance, one approval, and two run/collect/diagnostic-evaluation
branches. Its connections are checked by IDs, independent of serialization order:

- The plan requires both artifact IDs; runtime requires the plan; approval
  requires and binds the plan and runtime.
- Each run selects its distinct native `main:AXIS=CHOICE` cell and requires plan,
  runtime and approval. Exactly one run additionally requires the other run,
  declaring sequential execution.
- Each collection names its own run but requires the plan and **both** runs.
  Native collection records evidence for the entire lock.
- Each evaluation requires its own collection and uses the same inventoried
  single diagnostic `heldout_lm` suite, with CPU/default backend and no runtime
  selector.

Campaign, Controller, the shared locked-cell request and native evidence readers
remain the execution and evidence authorities. Cancellation preserves the native
attempt; ambiguous attempts and lost submissions refuse replacement. A comparison
is available only with valid complete native evidence for both cells. Pending,
failed, censored or invalid evidence does not establish comparability. A successful
pair is wiring evidence, not a scientific quality claim.

| Contract boundary | Regression coverage in `tests/test_workflow_pair.py` |
| --- | --- |
| Current admission | Strict limits, pilot accounting, obsolete-input refusal and unchanged native seed semantics |
| Authored graph | Renamed/reordered stages, distinct cells, approval, sequential runs and collection barriers |
| Native input identity | Snapshot members, tokenizer bytes and prepared-array tampering refuse before submission |
| Native comparability | Extra differences, invariant conflicts and unchanged declared interventions refuse |
| Isolated admission guards | `test_workflow_pair_guards.py`: shared dataset/tokenizer, CPU/snapshot profile, comparison shape, recovery and planning/runtime/approval/evaluation connections |
| Native lifecycle | Zero-wait submission, replay, cancellation, lost submission and ambiguous controller observations |
| Non-executing inspection | Import/effect fence; no payload reads or runtime launch |

Continuation/promotion, expanded evaluation contracts, generation panels,
portable attempt-contract ledgers and accelerator admission remain outside this
contract. Checkpoint collection precedes evaluation; terminal collection follows
all diagnostic evaluations and verifies their selected indices. Interim evidence
explicitly says `diagnostic_status: not_collected`.


## Authenticated workflow CLI

Run from the provisioned CPU interpreter selected in admission. These commands
require a separately admitted workload. **`apply` without `--execute-runs` may
still run native runtime acceptance probes.** Omitting the flag prevents model
run dispatch; it does not make `apply` an inspection-only command. Include these
probes in the admitted resource envelope and monitoring. Help and metadata
`inspect` remain non-executing. Preparation remains a separate
`recipe preparation apply/resume` operation; workflow execution consumes already
verified native artifacts.

```sh
sparselab experiment recipe workflow apply recipe/workflow.yaml --bindings local.yaml --admission admission.json --work-dir /absolute/work --json
sparselab experiment recipe workflow approve recipe/workflow.yaml gate --bindings local.yaml --admission admission.json --work-dir /absolute/work --note "authorized bounded CPU experiment" --json
sparselab experiment recipe workflow apply recipe/workflow.yaml --bindings local.yaml --admission admission.json --work-dir /absolute/work --execute-runs --max-wait-seconds 540 --json
sparselab experiment recipe workflow resume recipe/workflow.yaml --bindings local.yaml --admission admission.json --work-dir /absolute/work --json
```

Replace `gate` with the authored approval-stage ID. `approve --decision reject`
records a native rejection. No command implicitly approves. Each command reloads
and validates the descriptor, local bindings and strict admission document:

```json
{
  "reviewed_commit": "<full committed recipe SHA>",
  "recipe_sha256": "<recipe_sha256 from workflow inspect>",
  "binding_sha256": "<binding_sha256 from workflow inspect>",
  "cpu_python": "/absolute/provisioned/environment/bin/python",
  "limits": {
    "max_training_updates": 54,
    "max_target_positions": 1728,
    "max_eval_batches": 4
  }
}
```

Use the exact running interpreter path (`sys.executable`), not a guessed alias.
The reviewed commit is the **recipe repository** commit, distinct from the lab
software pin. Admission is a caller assertion, not automatic approval, compute
credit or remote author attestation. Keep admission and bindings outside the
committed recipe; require an absolute work root outside Git. Global prefix
work/token options do not select execution resources on this route.

`apply` and `resume` default to `execute_runs=false` and a 120-second native
controller wait. `--max-wait-seconds` accepts finite nonnegative seconds; zero
can queue without ticking a worker. It is not a whole-process resource limit.
Use the existing `sparselab monitor --policy POLICY --log-dir LOGS --workspace
WORK -- COMMAND ...` around admitted work. Pilots and probes remain additional
work beyond the main run's update budget. `resume` delegates native Campaign
replay/recovery; it does not assert full-state training resume was verified.

Execution and report commands emit one JSON object to stdout (with or without
`--json`); adapter progress goes to stderr. The envelope is
`sparselab-workflow-command-v1`, with `command` and native result fields.
Validation/I/O errors and native FAILED stages exit 1. Argument errors exit 2
with argparse diagnostics on stderr. As with native Campaign commands, waiting,
blocked, rejected or running stages can exit 0: inspect stage states; exit 0
does not mean complete or scientifically successful. Existing metadata command
output is unchanged.

### Publication report

Select the exact native plan-stage `availability.path` (lock) and
`availability.workspace`. Select the collect-stage `availability.path` (evidence
index), **not** the evaluation-stage index. Report rendering never recollects or
selects a newer snapshot automatically.

```sh
sparselab experiment recipe workflow report /work/plan.lock.json --workspace /work/experiment --index /work/evidence/index.json --output /work/report.json --json
sparselab experiment recipe workflow report /work/plan.lock.json --workspace /work/experiment --index /work/evidence/index.json --output /work/report.md --format markdown
```

The example paths are placeholders: use paths from native results. Supply both
`--workspace` and `--index`, or neither for a planned-only report. The report
adapter accepts native locks; it needs no execution admission and grants none.
It verifies the selected snapshot, preserves incomplete/missing evidence, writes
exclusively, permits identical-byte replay and refuses a different existing
output. No training, evaluation, acquisition or controller tick occurs. A later
evidence snapshot requires explicit native collection; this command does not
refresh the Campaign's earlier collection receipt. Keep the evaluation index
alongside the report when recording completed evaluation evidence.

### Independently authored Workshop example

The subsequent Workshop change must use the final reviewed lab pin and its
locked, provisioned CPU environment. It must not import `tests`, copy fixture
builders as a runtime dependency, or introduce another executor. Commit:

- A native synthetic RunConfig, one-cell ExperimentPlan, diagnostic heldout suite,
  native Campaign and workflow descriptor with complete member hashes and ports.
- Small synthetic preparation declarations and documented native preparation
  commands. Extract tokenizer/prepared identities from native receipts; bind their
  locations locally. Commit and review the workflow only after its identities
  are known. Changed preparation/code identities require fresh verification and
  a new recipe identity, never rewriting historical receipts.
- Exact lab/runtime pins, licenses, intended workload including pilots/probes,
  monitor policy, setup/approval/run/report instructions and expected evidence
  paths. Machine-local bindings, admission and generated payloads stay outside Git.

Freeze the final installed lab source identity **before fresh preparation**.
Commit preparation declarations at A and run them with admission for A. COMPLETE
preparation JSON stages expose `outputs` (native `kind`, `identifier`, `sha256`)
and `availability.path` (local location). A standard-library authoring helper can
select the expected stage IDs/kinds, require COMPLETE, copy those native identity
fields into the workflow's version-1 artifact records with an explicit producer,
and place paths in local bindings. It must not invent identities for missing or
failed stages. Commit that independently authored workflow at B and admit B.
Retain the A checkout and exact local binding/admission bytes for preparation
replay: advancing its checkout to B invalidates A's admission. Artifacts measured
under an earlier installed lab source identity are not reusable evidence for a
new installed source identity. Preserve them unchanged.

Acceptance needs a clean committed Workshop checkout, public CLI preparation and
workflow execution, explicit approval, one native completed/ingested attempt,
checkpoint-bound evaluation, verified report and replay without a new attempt.
Record recipe/lab/runtime pins and measured wall/RSS/workspace growth separately
from quality claims. That measured run and Workshop publication are subsequent
work, not established by CLI unit tests. Snapshot TinyStories, multiple cells,
continuations, generation panels and accelerators remain outside this profile.

| CLI boundary | Evidence in `tests/test_workflow_cli.py` |
| --- | --- |
| Public entry → authenticated native Campaign | Real tiny preparation, approval gate, zero-wait queue, no-tick replay |
| Admission → store/dispatch | Recipe/binding digest, interpreter, outside-Git, clean committed inventory and stale context refusals |
| New admission → existing approval | Rebound binding with updated admission rejects old receipt before worker tick |
| Native result → stdout/exit | Single JSON result, stderr progress, failed-stage exit, finite wait parsing |
| Native snapshot → report | Planned/evidence output, identical replay, no-clobber, corrupt-index and unpaired-input refusal |
| Help → optional imports | Fresh-process fences for every new subcommand |

These tests address the admission coverage correction in
[PR127 review 5512227409](https://github.com/supernovae/tiny-sparse-lab/pull/127#pullrequestreview-5512227409).
They preserve the existing guards rather than changing runtime contracts, legacy
seed acceptance or historical hashes. Normal safe/fast/lab-loop CI remains the
broader compatibility gate; no full measured training is added to CLI tests.

## Current workflow and evidence contract

There is one workflow admission shape, with required `limits`. Numeric
`workflow_admission_version` and `pair_limits` are obsolete and rejected before
workflow loading, store creation, probes or dispatch. Regenerate admissions from
the current recipe inspection and reviewed commit; do not rename fields in a
saved admission and reuse its historical authority or work root. Preparation
admission/binding consolidation is a separate pending slice.

One shared validator derives one synthetic cell or a controlled two-cell snapshot
comparison from the authored plan. Both require one terminal `experiment_collect`
stage covering all evaluation branches. For the paired example:

```yaml
- id: final-evidence
  kind: experiment_collect
  scope: evaluation
  plan: plan
  run: run-baseline
  evaluations: [eval-baseline, eval-candidate]
  requires: [plan, run-baseline, run-candidate, eval-baseline, eval-candidate]
```

For a single cell, use that cell's run and evaluation IDs. No other stage may
depend on terminal collection. Stage IDs remain authored; the native Campaign
executor owns dispatch, approval, cancellation and replay.

Evidence has one current shape: `format: sparselab-experiment-evidence-index`,
`diagnostic_status` (`not_collected` or `collected`) and `diagnostic_evaluations`
(always an array), alongside native execution coverage. It has no selectable
numeric version. Interim collection records an empty array and `not_collected`;
terminal collection requires exactly one explicitly bound diagnostic per completed
cell. It verifies run/checkpoint, locked suite, index/record and result bytes with
the native verifier. Missing or changed evidence refuses; `UNAVAILABLE` stays
unavailable and projects no metrics. Reopen and receipt replay reverify identity.

The report format is always `sparselab-publication-report`. JSON and Markdown use
the same report object's format, diagnostic status and observations, including
planned-only reports. Reporting is read-only: no training, scoring, acquisition,
controller advancement or implicit collection. Select the final stage's explicit
index when reporting final diagnostic coverage:

```sh
sparselab experiment recipe workflow report /work/experiment/locks/LOCK.json \
  --workspace /work/experiment --index /work/experiment/evidence/FINAL.json \
  --output /work/report.json --format json
```

Earlier numbered evidence contracts are refused with regeneration guidance;
this pre-release implementation adds no historical reader layer. Existing record
bytes and hashes remain untouched as development evidence. Current source pins,
new admissions and fresh work roots are required for new acceptance. Workshop's
pinned historical example is not automatically migrated or recertified.

`test_final_diagnostic_evidence` covers isolated identity/membership/uniqueness
checks, native byte verification, unavailable observations, replay and report
projection. Checkpoint verification is explicitly substituted in its byte
fixtures, so these are software tests, not model-quality or new measured workflow
proof. Existing CLI tests cover approval, queueing and no-new-attempt replay.
The pre-release baseline still needs separately admitted fresh public-CLI run,
completed replay and independent fresh-workspace repeat with criteria declared
before execution. No new model proof is included here.
