# Research workbench

SparseLab has two non-executing entry points: `sparselab learn list` for one initialized mechanism, and `sparselab research list` for declared controlled studies. Listing, describing, and scaffolding package metadata/configuration only: they do not train, fit a tokenizer, prepare data, open a run store, or access the network.

Current authoring uses an explicitly supplied resource closure. Prepare a current
entry, recipe with explicit seed options, base, profiles, datasets, source pins,
capability cards and lifecycle registry as described in the
[external-resource contract](../external-research-resources.md). In this example,
`neutral-study` is a placeholder for your own entry ID, not a packaged recipe;
`/path/to/resources` must be your complete local resource root.

```sh
sparselab learn list
sparselab research list
sparselab research scaffold neutral-study --resource-root /path/to/resources \
  --scale smoke --data offline --backend cpu --output experiments/new-study
sparselab study plan experiments/new-study/study.yaml
```

The packaged research list retains three historical cards pending separate
protocol retirement; it is not a list of scaffoldable recipes. The eight personal
recipe IDs were retired together with their catalog entries. Scaffolding does not
prepare data, run training, or grant authority to execute.

A scaffold publishes editable `base.yaml`, `tokenizer.yaml`, `matrix.yaml`, `study.yaml`, hashed standalone configs, and metadata. It does **not** execute them. Follow the generated README to train the tokenizer, prepare each required config's data, check a listed config before training an arm directly, or explicitly submit and collect a study. See [lesson paths](lesson-paths.md), [the experiment learning cycle](experiment-learning-cycle.md), [external resource authoring](../external-research-resources.md), [evidence and reporting](evidence-and-reporting.md), and [dashboard browsing](dashboard.md).

If you are unsure what to run next, start with the [experiment learning cycle](experiment-learning-cycle.md). It explains how to move from a known-good reference to the cheapest useful follow-up, distinguish broken evidence from a negative result, keep soft limitations from becoming retroactive gates, and decide when to stop, replicate, scale, branch, or promote.

The [research roadmap](roadmap.md) tracks capability evidence and open scientific
questions. Use [`experiments/samples/`](../../experiments/samples/) for copyable
teaching material and [`experiments/research/`](../../experiments/research/) for
real campaign definitions and iteration records. Mutable output belongs in the
external persistent root (`$SPARSELAB_WORK_DIR/experiments/`, or the XDG/home default);
declarations and compact verified evidence belong in Git. Report missing code through the
[contribution workflow](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#planning-and-contributions). Verified semantic retrieval accepts pre-encoded
vectors; a teacher-representation compiler and natural-language query encoder are
not shipped.

## Durable research and compact evidence

The [declaration-to-artifact lifecycle](lifecycle-recovery.md) explains commit-before-compute, read-only `research snapshot`, recovery manifests, checkpoint-bound EvaluationSuite/ModelReadiness, human-reviewed ModelFamily actions, and thin/portable archives. Publish small verified references without checking in data/checkpoints:

```sh
uv run --locked sparselab research evidence export --kind corpus_release <verified-release-dir> \
  --declaration <recovery.yaml> --output <evidence/release.json> --json
git add <evidence/release.json> && git commit -m "Record verified corpus identity"
```

The digest pins bytes and provenance, **not** scientific quality. A tokenizer-selection reference needs a verified selection receipt; a runtime probe is an observation. An absent external source and a lost checkpoint require different responses.

## Known-good decision records

The read-only lifecycle projection links bounded Findings, human dispositions,
declared next tests, and reviewed baseline promotions without changing catalog,
study, run, or report artifacts. Start with the [known-good baseline
guide](known-good-baselines.md) for the exact dense reference commands, gates,
capture requirements, branch workflow, and the distinction between archival
report verification and locally runnable checkpoint files.
The packaged lifecycle registry is empty. `sparselab report --kind research --json`
and `research validate --json` therefore provide no historical baseline clearance.
Select a current explicit registry to assess its declared evidence; historical
findings and baseline guides remain evidence of their recorded conditions only.

The [experiment ledger](experiment-ledger.md) centralizes retained lessons from
recall, context use, adaptation, architecture, exposure, scale and decoding
studies. Follow its evidence links for exact identities and controls; use the
[roadmap](roadmap.md) for declared next questions. Historical completion does not
imply local checkpoint availability or authorization to rerun a campaign.

Relative path values in matrix axis patches resolve from `matrix.yaml`; paths
in a base config resolve from that YAML file.

## Ownership-aware memory allocation

The personal allocation recipe is historical and no longer available as a
packaged scaffold. Its [archived corpus and allocation guide](../path-domain-corpus.md)
preserves the original declarations and limitations. A new allocation experiment
needs a current external resource closure, explicit seed options, actual input
bindings and a separately reviewed plan. No standard seed set is supplied by Lab.

Published worked examples: [FFN-substitution smoke report](../../artifacts/research-reports/fbdb00217f8e952e12bd07e053d97d85796f889748ee77d3bc81b21bb3c98c0b/index.html) and [nano/offline FFN follow-up report](../../artifacts/research-reports/a444e2869973568e28315aa2cac1a97454d7f9d7b8742fd69de8358e867e7daf/index.html), with their [outcomes and interpretation](sample-report.md).

## Controlled Engram portability

The explicit `research portability` runner binds generated worlds, direct token/byte compiles, semantic packs, independent recipient-preparation checkpoints, update audits, immutable checkpoint observations, A/B/A replacement probes, and censored threshold reports. Start with the [A/B/C/D/E/F/Z lifecycle guide](engram-portability.md). The former personal research recipe is archived in Workshop; it is not a current packaged scaffold.

The historical source-learned Experiment A is separate: [retained learned-portability protocol](learned-engram-portability.md). It trains a source byte table with DenseLM SGD and tests independent width-64/128 recipients; compiled-world artifacts and the MiniLM pilot are historical evidence, not substitutes.

Staged documentation-only definitions: [compiled knowledge Engrams](compiled-knowledge-engram-v1.md) and [compiled Engram initialization](compiled-engram-initialization-v1.md). Neither has a runnable recipe or catalog entry.

See the [research launcher contract audit](launcher-contracts.md) for retained
operations, the removed byte diagnostic wrapper and consolidation boundaries.
